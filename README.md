# custom-trading-limits
A Minecraft spigot plugin to set the max uses of villager trades available before restocking.


## Installation
Simply download the most recent releases .jar file that matches your minecraft version and drag the .jar file into your servers plugin folder. All releases can be found [here](https://github.com/CallumHerr/custom-trading-limits/releases).

## Configuration
Only one setting is currently configurable which is the amount of trades a player can do with a villager without the villager needing to restock. By default this is set to 9999 and can be manually set in the config.yml file. Alternatively this can also be set in game using the `/setmaxtrades` command.

## Permissions
One permission is available for the plugin which grants the player the ability to use the `/setmaxtrades` command. This permission is `custom-trading-limits.setlimit`, this can be set with any permission manager plugin.
